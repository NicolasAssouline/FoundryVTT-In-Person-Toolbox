# FoundryVTT Mobile Token Movement (revived)

_Credit for the base version goes to [MatthijsKok](https://gitlab.com/MatthijsKok)_

The original was outdated and didn't work for the current FoundryVTT version - this module looked perfect for use when DM-ing for my group 
so I updated it to work with FoundryVTT 11, polished up the code and added a couple new features

This repository is a reupload due to [the original](https://gitlab.com/MatthijsKok/mobile-token-movement) being on Gitlab

Use your mobile device to control your token with a minimal interface.  
Useful for in-person games with a player-facing monitor using the module Monk's Common Display.  

## How To Use
To enable the mobile interface, accept the popup dialog with your mobile device.  
Any device with a width smaller than 600px will get this popup dialog when connecting.

Make sure you have a character assigned to the users that will be on a mobile device.

## Compatibility
Tested with these modules:
- Monk's Common Display
- Auto-rotate
